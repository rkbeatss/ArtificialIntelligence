    "The supervised classification task tackled in this notebook is **polarity detection**, which is one possible activity within the quite popular trend of *Opinion Mining* in AI.  Many companies want to know whether there are positive or negative reviews about them.  Reviews can be on hotels, restaurants, movies, customer service of any kind, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will allow you to better understand an ***experimental set-up*** for supervised machine learning.  The notion of training set, test set, evaluation, bias, etc.  The notebook also introduces the notion of comparative evaluation.  To say if a method is good or not, we often compare it to a *baseline* approach.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook makes use of a really nice and popular machine learning package, called **scikit-learn** (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).  It contains many pre-coded machine learning algorithms which you can call.  To use this package, you must download it. You will also need to download **Pandas** which is a great tool for manipulating data to use in Machine Learning algorithms.  At the command prompt, type ***pip install sklearn*** and ***pip install pandas*** to download the packages.  \n",

    "In this notebook we will use the Naive Bayes implementation and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) implementation for polarity detection of a large movie review dataset, but we will explore other ML algorithms included in scikit-learn in future notebooks.  \n",

We will be using this dataset throughout the notebook so be sure to place it in the same directory as this notebook. It contains 480000 reviews with half of them being rotten and the other half being fresh. We will only use a subset of these due to the large computation time of the Baseline and SVM learners.\n"

It's also more restricted than *rating* in which we would like assign a value (0..5) to evaluate a particular service.

    "Just looking at it generally, they are performing better than the baseline approach. The baseline approach classified 1240 correctly out of 2000. The Naive Bayes approach classified 1525 correctly out of 2000. The SVM approach classified 1285 correctly out of 2000. \n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>If we used the training data on the Baseline approach, how would you theorize those results would compare to those from the test data (better, worse, maybe both)? Explain why the comparison of the train and test data predictions from the Baseline model may or may not (depending on your previous answer) resemble the comparison of the train and test predictions from the Naive Bayes and SVM learners.  </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "It would perform more or less the same due to the way that the Baseline approach is set up. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Present and discuss the overall results below (including the precision and recall comparisons). </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Training data on baseline: 6989 wrong predictions out of 18000 or 11011 correctly classified. Naive Bayes correctly classified 16250 total training examples out of 18000 examples. The SVM model correctly classified 13012 total training examples out of 18000 examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Give two suggestions (each) to help the Naive Bayes approach and the SVM approach within the context of our experiment of polarity detection for movie reviews.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes: Since negative and positive words can both be used in a review and only checking the frequency of the word means context information is lost. In <b>binarized (boolean) multinomial naive bayes</b>, the occurence of a word is more important than frequency. For example, if a word like \"fantastic\" occurs then that's more important (more telling) than the frequency of that word. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, a bigger data set works better for Naive Bayes as the probabilities for each class (in this case only two classes) will be more reliable. More features with a larger training set will lead to better results for Naive Bayes. \n",
    "\n",
    "SVM: Choosing a better kernel parameter (as this affects the outcome) may yield better results. \n",
